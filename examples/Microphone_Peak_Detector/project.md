Electrect Microphone Peak Detector 
=======================================

The smartSensors library is a ready to use set of functions that are very useful for managing analog and digital sensors.
Common operations like calculating min, max, average and trends are completely automated by the smartSensors library.
Moreover the smartSensors lib allows user to define calibration functions for analog sensors and to use callback to schedule sampling and acquisition operations.

In this example the analogSensors module is used to acquire data from the Electrect Microphone embedded in the Zerynth Shield but an be also used with any other analog sensor connected to an analog pin.
The analogSensors integrated routines are used to calculate the min-Max difference and then trigger a function if a threshold is passed.
Use this sensor to start to develop your knock triggered smart device.

Touch Smart Detector  
============================
The smartSensors library is a ready to use set of functions that are very useful for managing analog and digital sensors.
Common operations like calculating min, max, average and trends are completely automated by the smartSensors library.
Moreover the smartSensors lib allows user to define calibration functions for analog sensors and to use callback to schedule sampling and acquisition operations.

The Zerynth Shield Library onDoubleTouch method allows to monitor a digital input to be considered as button or touch sensor. 
The methods allow the definition of a set of functions to be called when a single, a double or a long touch is detected.
The functions also allow to adjust the detecting parameter s in term of time ranges and constrains.
